  abstract = {This work investigates the empirical performance of the sparse synthesis versus sparse analysis regularization for the ill-posed inverse problem of audio declipping. We develop a versatile non-convex heuristics which can be readily used with both data models. Based on this algorithm, we report that, in most cases, the two models perform almost similarly in terms of signal enhancement. However, the analysis version is shown to be amenable for real time audio processing, when certain analysis operators are considered. Both versions outperform state-of-the-art methods in the field, especially for the severely saturated signals.},

  abstract = {We deal with the problem of sparsity-based audio inpainting, i.e. filling in the missing segments of audio. A consequence of the approaches based on mathematical optimization is the insufficient amplitude of the signal in the filled gaps. Remaining in the framework based on sparsity and convex optimization, we propose improvements to audio inpainting, aiming at compensating for such an energy loss. The new ideas are based on different types of weighting, both in the coefficient and the time domains. We show that our propositions improve the inpainting performance in terms of both the SNR and ODG.},

It is an adaptation of the SPADE algorithm by Kitic´ et al., originally developed for audio declipping, to the task of audio inpainting. The new SPAIN (SParse Audio INpainter) comes in synthesis and analysis variants. Experiments show that both A-SPAIN and S-SPAIN outperform other sparsity-based inpainting algorithms. Moreover, A-SPAIN performs on a par with the state-of-the-art method based on linear prediction in terms of the SNR, and, for larger gaps, SPAIN is even slightly better in terms of the PEMO-Q psychoacoustic criterion.},

Alongside this approach, there is an analysis counterpart model, which, despite its similarity to the synthesis alternative, is markedly different. Surprisingly, the analysis model did not get a similar attention, and its understanding today is shallow and partial.},

  abstract = {The state of the art in audio declipping has currently been achieved by SPADE (SParse Audio DEclipper) algorithm by Kiti´c et al. Until now, the synthesis/sparse variant, S-SPADE, has been considered significantly slower than its analysis/cosparse counterpart, A-SPADE. It turns out that the opposite is true: by exploiting a recent projection lemma, individual iterations of both algorithms can be made equally computationally expensive, while S-SPADE tends to require considerably fewer iterations to converge. In this paper, the two algorithms are compared across a range of parameters such as the window length, window overlap and redundancy of the transform. The experiments show that although S-SPADE typically converges faster, the average performance in terms of restoration quality is not superior to A-SPADE.},
